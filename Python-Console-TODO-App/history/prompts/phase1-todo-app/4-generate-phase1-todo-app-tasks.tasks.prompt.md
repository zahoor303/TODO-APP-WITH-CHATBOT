# Generate Phase I Todo App Tasks

## Outcome
Created the complete implementation tasks file for Phase I of the Hackathon II project: an in-memory Python console todo application with 45 specific, actionable tasks organized by user story priority and dependencies.

## Evaluation
The implementation tasks successfully break down the todo application into small, actionable steps organized by user story priority. The tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths. Parallel execution opportunities are identified, and dependencies between user stories are clearly documented. The tasks cover all required components from the pyproject.toml to the CLI interface, data models, services, storage, and testing.

## Prompt Text
```
/sp.tasks
Generate an actionable, dependency-ordered tasks.md for the feature based on available design artifacts.
Context for task generation: Break Phase I into small, ordered tasks (max 2 hrs each): 1. Create pyproject.toml with rich, typer, pytest 2. Implement Task dataclass (models.py) 3. Build InMemoryStorage with list + UUID 4. Create reusable TodoCRUDSubagent class inside storage.py 5. Build TodoService with validation 6. Implement Typer CLI (add, list, update, delete, toggle) 7. Make beautiful rich table with emojis and Urdu text 8. Write main.py with welcome panel 9. Add pytest tests 10. Write README + CLAUDE.md Output: tasks/phase1/tasks.md with Status column (TODO/DONE)
```

## Response Text
Created the complete implementation tasks file for Phase I with:

1. tasks.md organized in 8 phases:
   - Phase 1: Setup (project initialization)
   - Phase 2: Foundational components (data models and storage)
   - Phase 3: User Story 1 - Add Task (Priority P1)
   - Phase 4: User Story 2 - View All Tasks (Priority P1)
   - Phase 5: User Story 3 - Update Task (Priority P2)
   - Phase 6: User Story 4 - Delete Task (Priority P2)
   - Phase 7: User Story 5 - Mark Complete/Incomplete (Priority P3)
   - Phase 8: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

2. 45 specific tasks following the required checklist format:
   - Each task has proper ID (T001-T045)
   - Tasks are properly labeled with [US1], [US2], etc. for user stories
   - Parallelizable tasks marked with [P] flag
   - All tasks include specific file paths
   - Tasks organized by dependency order and priority

3. Implementation strategy section with MVP approach
4. Dependencies section showing user story completion order
5. Parallel execution examples grouped by functionality
