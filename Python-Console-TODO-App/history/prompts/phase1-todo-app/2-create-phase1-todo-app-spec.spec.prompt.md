# Create Phase I Todo App Specification

## Outcome
Created the complete feature specification for Phase I of the Hackathon II project: an in-memory Python console todo application. The specification includes user stories, functional requirements, success criteria, and validation checklists.

## Evaluation
The specification successfully captures all required functionality for the console todo app, including the ability to add, view, update, delete, and mark tasks as complete/incomplete. It incorporates the requirement for Urdu language support, reusable TodoCRUDSubagent class, and adherence to the project's constitution principles. The specification is ready for the planning phase.

## Prompt Text
```
/sp.specify
Phase I: In-Memory Python Console Todo App (Hackathon II) Goal: Build the foundation of the entire 5-phase project using pure spec-driven development. This phase proves we can generate perfect code without typing a single line manually. User Stories (What & Why, no tech yet): - As a busy user, I want to quickly add a task with title & optional description so I don't forget anything - As a user, I want to see all my tasks in a beautiful colored table so I know what's pending - As a user, I want to update a task by ID when plans change - As a user, I want to delete a task that's no longer needed - As a user, I want to mark a task complete/incomplete to feel productive Bonus Requirements (already in constitution): - Create a reusable TodoCRUDSubagent class that will be imported in Phase II–V - Add Urdu prompts & success messages (e.g., "Task ban gaya!", "Title daaliye:") Acceptance Criteria: - Runs with: uv run main.py - Uses only UV + rich + typer - Rich table with emojis (Done / Pending), colors, borders - Task model has: id (UUID), title, description (optional), completed, created_at - Input validation (title 1–200 chars) - Graceful error handling (invalid ID → red message) - Zero manual code — everything from Claude Output: Generate specs/phase1/spec.md + specs/phase1/user-stories.md with clear tables that judges can tick.
