# Create Project Constitution

## Outcome
Created the project constitution for "Hackathon II – The Evolution of Todo: Mastering Spec-Driven Development & Cloud Native AI" at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` with immutable principles, constraints, governance, and success checklist.

## Evaluation
The constitution establishes the foundational principles for the hackathon project, defining the spec-driven approach, tech stack adherence, multi-language support, monorepo structure, code quality standards, deployment practices, bonuses integration, and documentation requirements. It serves as the governing document for all five phases of the hackathon.

## Prompt Text
```
/sp.constitution
Project: Hackathon II – The Evolution of Todo: Mastering Spec-Driven Development & Cloud Native AI

This constitution governs the ENTIRE hackathon from Phase I (Console App) to Phase V (Cloud Deployment), simulating real-world software evolution. It ensures AI-native, spec-driven approach where engineer is "system architect" not "syntax writer".

Immutable Principles (Apply to All Phases, Never Change):
- Spec-Driven Development: 100% code and infrastructure generated by Claude Code; zero manual writing; refine specs until output is correct; use Spec-Kit Plus for all specs/plans/tasks/implements.
- Reusable Intelligence: Every phase must create/use Claude Code Subagents and Agent Skills (e.g., CRUD subagent in Phase I, reusable for II-V); aim for +200 bonus by making skills modular (e.g., agents/skills/ folder).
- Tech Stack Adherence: UV for Python deps; Python 3.13+ with type hints; Next.js 16+ App Router for frontend; FastAPI for backend; SQLModel ORM; Neon Postgres DB; OpenAI Agents/ChatKit/MCP SDK for AI; Docker/Minikube/Helm for K8s; Kafka (Redpanda) + Dapr for event-driven; kubectl-ai/kagent/Gordon for AIOps.
- Multi-Language Support: Add Urdu in user-facing parts (console prompts, web UI, chatbot responses) for +100 bonus; voice commands for +200 bonus in Phase III+.
- Monorepo Structure: Root with .spec-kit/config.yaml, specs/ (organized by features/api/database/ui), CLAUDE.md (root + frontend/backend), frontend/, backend/, agents/, skills/, docker-compose.yml; reference specs with @specs/path.md.
- Code Quality & Cleanliness: SOLID principles, PEP 8, full tests (pytest); stateless design where possible (e.g., chat endpoint in Phase III); error handling graceful; UX beautiful (rich tables in console, Tailwind in web).
- Deployment & Ops: Local Minikube for Phase IV; Cloud (DOKS/GKE/AKS) for V; use Helm charts generated by kubectl-ai/kagent; CI/CD with GitHub Actions; monitoring/logging.
- Bonuses Integration: Create Cloud-Native Blueprints via Agent Skills for +200 (e.g., spec-driven K8s deploys); full bonuses (600) target by Phase V.
- Documentation: README.md with setup/run/deploy; CLAUDE.md with workflow (e.g., "Implement @specs/features/task-crud.md"); demo videos <90s per phase.

Constraints:
- No manual code/infra; if Claude fails, refine spec.
- Authentication: Better Auth with JWT from Phase II.
- Features Progression: Basic (5 CRUD) in all phases; add Intermediate (priorities/tags/search/filter/sort) + Advanced (recurring/due dates/reminders) in Phase V.
- Event-driven: Kafka + Dapr from Phase V; pub/sub for reminders/recurring/audits/sync.
- Platforms: WSL2 for Windows; free tiers (Neon, Redpanda, DO $200 credit).

Governance:
- This constitution supersedes all; amendments only via new /sp.constitution with version bump and rationale.
- All specs/plans must explicitly reference this constitution.
- Violations: Document in specs/amendments.md.

Success Checklist (For Full 1000 + 600 Points):
- [ ] Spec-Driven: All code from Claude, specs history complete.
- [ ] Reusable: Subagents/skills used across phases.
- [ ] Bonuses: Urdu + Voice + Blueprints implemented.
- [ ] Deployments: Local Minikube + Cloud DOKS working.
- [ ] Features: All levels (Basic/Intermediate/Advanced) in V.

## Response Text
Created the constitution file at `.specify/memory/constitution.md` with all the specified principles and structure. The file contains:

1. Immutable principles section with detailed explanations
2. Constraints section outlining project limitations
3. Governance section with amendment procedures
4. Success checklist for tracking project completion
5. Version information with dates

The constitution is formatted in Markdown with appropriate headings and follows all the requirements specified in the prompt.
