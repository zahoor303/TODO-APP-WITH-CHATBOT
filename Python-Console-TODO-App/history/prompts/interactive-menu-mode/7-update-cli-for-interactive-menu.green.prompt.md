# Update CLI for Interactive Menu

## Outcome
Successfully updated main.py to show a help menu by default when run without arguments, fulfilling the requirement to make the CLI more interactive and user-friendly.

## Evaluation
The implementation successfully changes the default behavior of the CLI so that running `uv run main.py` displays all available commands like a menu instead of showing an error. The solution maintains backward compatibility, so all existing commands continue to work as before.

## Prompt Text
```
Please update the CLI so that when I run: uv run main.py it should automatically show all options and commands — like a menu — without showing an error. That means: 1. Default behavior should display the help text. 2. The app should NOT require a command. 3. Running `main.py` should show all available commands (add, list, remove, complete, etc.) directly. Please modify main.py to support this default interactive mode.
```

## Response Text
Updated main.py to implement the interactive menu mode:

1. Modified main.py to check if arguments are provided when the application starts
2. When no arguments are provided (len(sys.argv) == 1), temporarily set sys.argv to include '--help' to trigger Typer's help display
3. Restored the original sys.argv after displaying help to avoid side effects
4. Verified that all existing functionality remains intact when commands are provided

The implementation now allows users to run `uv run main.py` and see all available commands in a menu format, while maintaining backward compatibility with all existing commands.
