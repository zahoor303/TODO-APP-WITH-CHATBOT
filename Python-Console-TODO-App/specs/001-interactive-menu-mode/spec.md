# Feature Specification: Interactive Menu Mode for CLI

**Feature Branch**: `001-interactive-menu-mode`
**Created**: 2025-12-12
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Please update the CLI so that when I run: uv run main.py it should automatically show all options and commands — like a menu — without showing an error. That means: 1. Default behavior should display the help text. 2. The app should NOT require a command. 3. Running `main.py` should show all available commands (add, list, remove, complete, etc.) directly. Please modify main.py to support this default interactive mode."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Interactive Menu Display (Priority: P1)

As a user, when I run `uv run main.py` without any arguments, I want to see a menu of all available commands so I can choose what to do next.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality requested by the feature - making the CLI more user-friendly with a default menu display.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the application without arguments and verifying it shows the help menu instead of throwing an error.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user runs `uv run main.py`, **When** no command is specified, **Then** application displays all available commands in a user-friendly menu format
2. **Given** user sees the menu, **When** user selects a command from the help display, **Then** appropriate command executes as expected

### User Story 2 - Command Availability (Priority: P1)

As a user, I want all existing commands (add, list, update, delete, complete, incomplete) to be visible in the default menu so I know what actions are possible.

**Why this priority**: Essential to ensure all functionality is discoverable by users from the main menu.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the application without arguments and verifying all existing commands are listed in the help menu.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user runs `uv run main.py`, **When** menu is displayed, **Then** all commands (add, list, update, delete, complete, incomplete) are visible
2. **Given** user runs `uv run main.py --help`, **When** help is displayed, **Then** all commands are also visible (maintains compatibility)

### User Story 3 - Graceful Default Behavior (Priority: P2)

As a user, I want the application to not show errors when run without commands so I have a positive first experience.

**Why this priority**: Part of improving user experience by removing friction points.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the application without arguments and verifying no error messages appear.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user runs `uv run main.py`, **When** no command is provided, **Then** application runs without errors and shows the menu
2. **Given** user accidentally runs `uv run main.py` without arguments, **When** application runs, **Then** it shows help instead of error message

### Edge Cases

- What happens when user runs the application with an invalid command?
- How does the system handle partial command matches?
- What occurs when the terminal is too small to display the full menu?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST display help menu when run without commands
- **FR-002**: System MUST show all available commands (add, list, update, delete, complete, incomplete) in the default menu
- **FR-003**: System MUST NOT show errors when run without arguments
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain backward compatibility with existing commands
- **FR-005**: System MUST provide clear instructions on how to use each command in the menu
- **FR-006**: System MUST preserve existing functionality while adding menu feature

### Key Entities

- **Interactive CLI**: The command-line interface that displays a menu when run without arguments
- **Command Menu**: The display showing all available commands with descriptions

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can run `uv run main.py` without arguments and see a helpful menu of options
- **SC-002**: All existing functionality remains accessible and works as before
- **SC-003**: User error rate when starting the application decreases (no more error on default run)
- **SC-004**: User satisfaction with application discoverability increases (measurable via usage of different commands)
- **SC-005**: Time to first successful command execution decreases for new users
