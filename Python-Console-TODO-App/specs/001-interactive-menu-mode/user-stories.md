# User Stories: Interactive Menu Mode for CLI

## Overview
This document details the user stories for adding an interactive menu mode to the CLI application so that running `uv run main.py` shows all available commands like a menu.

## User Stories Table

| ID | User Story | Priority | Acceptance Criteria | Status |
|----|------------|----------|-------------------|--------|
| US-001 | As a user, when I run `uv run main.py` without any arguments, I want to see a menu of all available commands so I can choose what to do next | P1 | Running the app without commands displays a helpful menu instead of an error | Pending |
| US-002 | As a user, I want all existing commands (add, list, update, delete, complete, incomplete) to be visible in the default menu so I know what actions are possible | P1 | All commands are visible in the default menu with descriptions | Pending |
| US-003 | As a user, I want the application to not show errors when run without commands so I have a positive first experience | P2 | Application runs without errors and shows the menu when run without arguments | Pending |

## Acceptance Criteria Checklist

- [ ] Running `uv run main.py` displays all commands in a user-friendly menu format
- [ ] No error is shown when running the app without arguments
- [ ] All existing commands are accessible via the menu
- [ ] All existing functionality remains available and works as before
- [ ] Backward compatibility is maintained
- [ ] Menu is displayed when no command is specified

## Validation Scenarios

### Default Menu Display
- Given: User runs `uv run main.py` without arguments
- When: Application starts
- Then: Help menu with all commands is displayed (not an error)

### Command Execution
- Given: User has seen the help menu
- When: User runs a specific command like `uv run main.py list`
- Then: That specific command executes as before

### Menu Content
- Given: User runs `uv run main.py`
- When: Menu is displayed
- Then: All commands (add, list, update, delete, complete, incomplete) are visible with descriptions

## Edge Cases to Handle

- Invalid command input after seeing menu
- Terminal size limitations affecting menu display
- Compatibility with existing command-line options like --help
