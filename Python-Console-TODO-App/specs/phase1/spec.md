# Feature Specification: Phase I - In-Memory Python Console Todo App (Hackathon II)

**Feature Branch**: `001-phase1-todo-app`
**Created**: 2025-12-12
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Phase I: In-Memory Python Console Todo App (Hackathon II) Goal: Build the foundation of the entire 5-phase project using pure spec-driven development. This phase proves we can generate perfect code without typing a single line manually. User Stories (What & Why, no tech yet): - As a busy user, I want to quickly add a task with title & optional description so I don't forget anything - As a user, I want to see all my tasks in a beautiful colored table so I know what's pending - As a user, I want to update a task by ID when plans change - As a user, I want to delete a task that's no longer needed - As a user, I want to mark a task complete/incomplete to feel productive Bonus Requirements (already in constitution): - Create a reusable TodoCRUDSubagent class that will be imported in Phase II–V - Add Urdu prompts & success messages (e.g., \"Task ban gaya!\", \"Title daaliye:\") Acceptance Criteria: - Runs with: uv run main.py - Uses only UV + rich + typer - Rich table with emojis (Done / Pending), colors, borders - Task model has: id (UUID), title, description (optional), completed, created_at - Input validation (title 1–200 chars) - Graceful error handling (invalid ID → red message) - Zero manual code — everything from Claude Output: Generate specs/phase1/spec.md + specs/phase1/user-stories.md with clear tables that judges can tick."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Add Task (Priority: P1)

A busy user wants to quickly add a task with title and optional description so they don't forget anything.

**Why this priority**: This is the most basic functionality of a todo app - without the ability to add tasks, the app has no value.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the application and adding tasks via the command-line interface, verifying the tasks are stored with UUID, timestamp, and status.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user opens the console app, **When** user selects add task option and enters valid title, **Then** task is added with pending status and UUID identifier
2. **Given** user wants to add task with description, **When** user enters title and optional description, **Then** task is saved with both title and description fields

---

### User Story 2 - View All Tasks (Priority: P1)

A user wants to see all their tasks in a beautiful colored table so they know what's pending.

**Why this priority**: Without being able to view tasks, users can't track their productivity or manage their workload.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the application with sample tasks and viewing the task list in a formatted table with colors, emojis, and borders.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has multiple tasks in the system, **When** user requests to view all tasks, **Then** all tasks are displayed in a rich, colored table with appropriate emojis
2. **Given** tasks have different completion statuses, **When** user views the task list, **Then** completed and pending tasks are visually distinguished using emojis and colors

---

### User Story 3 - Update Task (Priority: P2)

A user wants to update a task by ID when plans change.

**Why this priority**: After adding and viewing tasks, users need to modify existing tasks as their plans evolve.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by updating an existing task's details and verifying the changes are reflected when viewing the task list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has existing tasks, **When** user selects update task option and enters valid task ID with new details, **Then** specified task is updated with new information
2. **Given** user enters invalid task ID, **When** user attempts to update the task, **Then** appropriate error message is displayed and no changes occur

---

### User Story 4 - Delete Task (Priority: P2)

A user wants to delete a task that's no longer needed.

**Why this priority**: Users need to clean up their task lists by removing obsolete tasks.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by deleting a specific task and verifying it no longer appears in the task list.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has existing tasks, **When** user selects delete task option and enters valid task ID, **Then** specified task is removed from the system
2. **Given** user enters invalid task ID, **When** user attempts to delete the task, **Then** appropriate error message is displayed and no deletion occurs

---

### User Story 5 - Mark Task Complete/Incomplete (Priority: P3)

A user wants to mark a task complete/incomplete to feel productive.

**Why this priority**: Tracking progress is essential to the todo app experience, enhancing user satisfaction.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by changing a task's completion status and verifying the change reflects in the task list view.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** user has pending tasks, **When** user marks a task as complete, **Then** the task shows as completed when viewed again
2. **Given** user has completed tasks, **When** user marks a task as incomplete, **Then** the task shows as pending when viewed again

### Edge Cases

- What happens when user enters a title with more than 200 characters?
- How does system handle non-existent task IDs during update/delete operations?
- What occurs when user tries to mark completion for a non-existent task ID?
- How does the system behave when there are no tasks to display?
- What happens when system encounters invalid input types?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to add tasks with title and optional description
- **FR-002**: System MUST assign unique UUID identifiers to each task upon creation
- **FR-003**: System MUST store timestamps indicating when tasks were created
- **FR-004**: System MUST maintain task completion status (pending vs completed)
- **FR-005**: System MUST display all tasks in a rich, colored table with emojis, colors, and borders
- **FR-006**: System MUST allow users to update task details by specifying the task ID
- **FR-007**: System MUST allow users to delete tasks by specifying the task ID
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow users to mark tasks as complete or incomplete by specifying the task ID
- **FR-009**: System MUST validate that title is between 1 and 200 characters when adding/updating tasks
- **FR-010**: System MUST gracefully handle invalid task IDs and display appropriate error messages
- **FR-011**: System MUST implement multilingual support including Urdu prompts and success messages
- **FR-012**: System MUST be accessible via the command: uv run main.py
- **FR-013**: System MUST implement a reusable TodoCRUDSubagent class for import in later phases
- **FR-014**: System MUST generate no manual code - everything must be from Claude AI assistant

### Key Entities

- **Task**: Represents a user's todo item with attributes: id (UUID), title, description (optional), completed (boolean), created_at (timestamp)
- **TodoCRUDSubagent**: Reusable class that encapsulates all task management functionality for import in Phase II–V

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Users can add new tasks in under 30 seconds using the command-line interface
- **SC-002**: Task display shows properly formatted rich table with emojis (✓ for done, ○ for pending), distinct colors, and borders
- **SC-003**: All CRUD operations (create, read, update, delete) complete successfully with appropriate confirmation messages
- **SC-004**: System handles invalid inputs gracefully by displaying clear, helpful error messages
- **SC-005**: Urdu language support is available for all prompts and success messages (e.g., "Task ban gaya!" for task created)
- **SC-006**: The TodoCRUDSubagent class can be imported and used in future phases without modification
- **SC-007**: Application successfully runs with the command: uv run main.py
- **SC-008**: Zero manual code written - all code generated by Claude AI assistant
