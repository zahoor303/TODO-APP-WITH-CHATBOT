# Feature Specification: Interactive Terminal Menu for Todo App

**Feature Branch**: `002-interactive-terminal-menu`
**Created**: 2025-12-12
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Please modify the project so that it no longer works like a Typer command-based CLI. I want this behavior: When I run: uv run main.py It should directly open an interactive menu (NOT show the Typer commands). Example: ╭──────── Todo App ────────╮ │ 1. Add Task │ │ 2. List Tasks │ │ 3. Update Task │ │ 4. Delete Task │ │ 5. Complete Task │ │ 6. Mark Incomplete │ │ 7. Exit │ ╰───────────────────────────╯ Choose an option: Then the flow should work like this: If I select 1 → app should ask: Enter task title: Enter task description: Task added successfully! If I select 3 → app should ask: Enter task number to update: New title: New description: All features must run through this interactive menu: - Add task - List tasks - Update task - Delete task - Complete task - Incomplete task - Exit Please remove the need for Typer commands entirely. Running `uv run main.py` should start the interactive app immediately."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Interactive Menu Display (Priority: P1)

### Edge Cases

- What happens when a user enters invalid input (non-numeric) for menu selection?
- How does the system handle extremely long task titles or descriptions?
- What occurs when a user tries to operate on a non-existent task?
- How does the system behave when the terminal window is resized during interaction?
