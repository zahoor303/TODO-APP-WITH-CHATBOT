## PROMPT

/sp.tasks

## RESPONSE

I have generated the `tasks.md` file with a detailed breakdown of the tasks required to implement the AI Chatbot feature. The file is located at `specs/006-chatbot-task-management/tasks.md`.

**Summary:**
- **Total Tasks**: 34
- **Tasks per User Story**:
    - US1 (Add): 4
    - US2 (List): 3
    - US3 (Complete): 3
    - US4 (Delete): 3
    - US5 (Update): 3
    - US6 (Frontend): 4
    - US7 (Urdu): 3
    - US8 (Voice): 3
- **Parallel Opportunities**: Identified for backend tool implementation and frontend setup.
- **Independent Test Criteria**: Defined for each user story.
- **Suggested MVP Scope**: User Story 1 (Add Task) and User Story 2 (List Tasks).

I am ready for the next command.
