## PROMPT

ERROR:root:Error creating task: (psycopg2.errors.ForeignKeyViolation) insert or update on table "task" violates foreign key constraint "task_user_id_fkey"
DETAIL:  Key (user_id)=(00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000001) is not present in table "user".

## RESPONSE

I have fixed the issue where the hardcoded user was not being created on startup, which caused the foreign key violation. Please restart your backend server for the changes to take effect.
