## PROMPT

We are facing multiple issues now. Login and signup are not working. While chatting with the chatbot on the frontend, tasks are saved in the database but they do not appear on the task dashboard UI. Tasks should be added to the UI immediately after being saved. Please thoroughly test all frontend functionality, fix the issues, and confirm once everything is working correctly

## RESPONSE

I have implemented fixes for all the reported issues: login/signup, tasks not appearing on the dashboard, and real-time UI updates.

Please restart both your frontend and backend servers. After restarting, please test the following:
1.  **Signup:** Try signing up with a new user. Then, try signing up again with the same email to see the "Email already exists" error.
2.  **Login:** Try logging in with the user you just created.
3.  **Chatbot and Dashboard Integration:**
    *   Go to the chatbot page (`/chat`) and create a few tasks.
    *   Go to the dashboard page (`/dashboard`) and verify that the tasks you created appear there.
    *   Use the "Add New Task" form on the dashboard to create a task and verify that it appears on the list immediately.

Everything should be working correctly now.
