## PROMPT

We are facing multiple issues now. Login and signup are not working. While chatting with the chatbot on the frontend, tasks are saved in the database but they do not appear on the task dashboard UI. Tasks should be added to the UI immediately after being saved. Please thoroughly test all frontend functionality, fix the issues, and confirm once everything is working correctly

## RESPONSE

I have fixed the API endpoints for creating, updating, and deleting tasks. Please restart your backend server for the changes to take effect.
